## This is an example of taking the second page of the travel fly website, the about page, and making it responsive as well


Our objectives for this particular webpage were to:

Practice how to make your site responsive

Set up a base that we can use for our future pages to keep them looking connected with the header and footer

Use media queries

Use percentages

I made this webpage using the format for the header and footer that I created in the last project. I then removed all of the web page's content and added in the new content that is on the about page. After that, I had to tweak some of the values for widths to fit the webpage correctly, and then I finally went on to make media queries and percentages to make all of the new page's content be adaptive to the size of the page.
